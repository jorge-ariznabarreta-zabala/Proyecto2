HTML & CSS details to be researched by classmates. Learning HTML &amp;CSS
Items to be explained in class @ F5 Pe√±ascal Bootcamp 2022-2023
We decided to create an HTML & CSS website, so we can practice the code and we also could explain real code to the classmates

The items to be researched are:
## A- Sizes: absolute and relative sizes. 
  Expalined with font-size propiety.
  px as absolute size
  vh, vw, em & rem as relative sizes
  You can change width and height of your browser and will notice that fonts grow and shrink

## B- Color: HTML name, rgb(a), hsl(a)
  Explained with examples in the HTML and linked to w3schools example
  
## C- background-image
  We took advantage of this item's complexity to use a private CSS page: Mihai.css
  Explained with examples in the HTML and linked to w3schools examples
  At the end of the page, we added an explanation of the background propiety that acts as a container of the different details expalined above

## D- font: local and remote fonts explained, @font-face
  We first expalined font "container" propiety, then each detail.
  Then explained remote fonts from Google fonts, and remote icons from FontAwesome and GoogleFonts/GoogleIcons
  Finally explained howto @font-face to "create a font called "manolo" from remote font.
